## Python Requirements

This project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage its Python dependencies.  
This file lists all the external Python packages your project needs to run.

### What is `requirements.txt`?

- Itâ€™s a plain text file.
- Each line specifies a package and (optionally) a version.
- It allows anyone to quickly install all dependencies with a single command.

### How to Install Dependencies

Before running the application, make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Navigate to the project directory** (where `requirements.txt` is located).
3. **Run:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   This will automatically download and install all required packages.

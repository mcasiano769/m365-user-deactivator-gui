Having trouble with the M365 User Deactivator GUI?  
This guide covers common issues and solutions for installation, setup, and usage.


## 1. Installation Issues

### "Python was not found"
- **Problem:** Windows can't find Python when running `python` or `pip`.
- **Solutions:**
  - Try using `py` instead of `python`:
    ```bash
    py m365_user_deactivator_gui.py
    ```
  - Make sure Python is installed and added to your PATH.
  - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and reinstall, checking "Add Python to PATH" during setup.

### "pip is not recognized"
- **Problem:** `pip` command not found.
- **Solutions:**
  - Use `python -m pip` or `py -m pip`:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  - Ensure pip is installed (it comes with modern Python versions).
